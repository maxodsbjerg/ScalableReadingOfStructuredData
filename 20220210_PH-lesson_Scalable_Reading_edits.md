l40/156: what is meant by 'timely dimensions'? Is this about chronology? *Changed throughout to chronology/chronologically*

l50: is 'solved' the correct word choice here? *Changed to explored and answered*. 

l58: is gender a binary? Solving this problem led us to rephrase this analytical step in more detail. *Section rewritten. We have tried to explain how a datasetâ€™s existing metadata categories to create questions that can be answered using a binary logic.*  

l65: you should note here that is the reader doesn't have a dataset to hand, you will explain how to acquire one in the next section *has been clarified*. 

l67: what does 'the free Essential' mean here? *Clarified*. 

l67-8: please use the full citations to these articles (at the bottom of the page) as you would with another journal. *Have tried to use CMoS guidelines for notes?*. 

l70-l117: users should be guided in using R and installing packages, for example by reference to other articles on PH. *Moved text from line 127-132 to line 70*. 

l108: capitalise 'Twitter'. This should be consistent throughout. *Taken care of*. 

l113: you assume that the reader knows what a 'datafarme' is. Either: briefly explain what this is, link to explanatory information, or signal that this isn't an introductory article (because introductory articles do not assume knowledge of particular programming architectures) *Updated with a short explanation*. 

l119: light word choice edits. 

l126: this intro to what R packages are and how to install them should come around l70-l117. *Moved text from line 127-132 to line 70*. 

l134-139: light word choice edits. 

l142: typo. 
l149: mention of regex should point to guidance on regular expressions. *Added brief explanation of regex and reference to PH-article on regex*. 
l199: what does 'our needs' refer to here? What are 'our needs' at this point in the article? *Has been clarified*. 
l211: light word choice edit. 
l215: adapt note on dates *Not quite sure if this one is a light edit or something for us to look at?*. 
l236: again, recommend removing example that suggests gender is a binary. *Section has been rewritten, see comment above.*. 
l238: above, I've suggested not saying 'top 20 liked tweets' and replacing that with something like '20 most commonly liked tweets'. I suggest this revision is made throughout, as 'top' could be considered colloquial. *Have tried to adapt but witout making the text too difficult to read*. 
l336: added quote marks to "favorite_count". General point: please check the use of quote marks and code blocks for consistency as they appear to be missing or used differently at different points in the article to refer to code, variables, packages, or datasets. *Quote marks now refer to variables and specification in code and code block ticks refer to functions*. 
l43: what does 'all' mean in the heading here? *Rewritten for clarification*. 
l394: what do you mean by 'Global Environment' here? *Added explanation on how to find the Global environment*. 

p 18 - if the user is trying to get twitter data using the rtweet package, there should be a note warning that the progress bar refers to the total number of requested tweets, rather than the progress of the operation. That is, if the reader requests 18000 tweets, but only 2600 are available, the progress bar will be stuck at about 15%, which might confuse people (it certainly confused me). *Added an explanation of this*. 
p 28 - fig. 1 and the code that creates it should probably include a scale on the y axis *Updated code and pictures so it is now showing scale on y-axis*. 
p 40 - the heading 'Interaction count dispersed on verified status' seems a bit confusing to me *Rewritten for clarification*. 
p 61 - perhaps a few lines explaining why we are exporting to JSON specifically (as opposed to, say, csv) *Explanation written and link to PH-lesson about reshaping JSON*.
